      This application was my final project of CS411 course in UIUC. The goal of this project, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiGEITdZ8eo"><i>GoDutch</i></a>, 
      is to help people better manage their grocery bill and also split the charge with their friends reasonably. 
      It can recognize and store the information from a receipt upon user scanning using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">OCR</a>. 
      For frequent users, our app could also automatically predict the products that the user frequently purchases from historical data (previous receipts).

      I implemented these two single-page web games while learning React JS and the basics of web development. 
      Through developing them in 2 weeks I gained the skills and knowledge of Web Design and front-end development
      which helped my future exploration on building insteresting softwares.
